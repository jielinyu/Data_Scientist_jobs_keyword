Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.
For Elevate Only - Data Scientist
At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and frustration in their financial lives.

Streamlining the deployment and maintenance of machine learning models by facilitating efficient model updates and creating robust operational monitoring.
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow
The Ideal Candidate will be:

A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
A Stickler for good software: You have a reverence for DevOps and don’t consider any piece of code complete without a thorough testing suite.
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
Benefits
Your choice of hardware - latest MacBook Pro or HP EliteBook and all the monitors you want!

The Data Science & Engineering team acts as the impact multiplier for Shopify’s product teams, putting over 11 petabytes of retail data to work to make our merchants more successful. From delivering merchandising insights, to optimizing shipping and processing rates, to reducing credit card fraud, to ad campaign recommendations - our Data Scientists deliver solutions from pipeline to platform. But what does “impact” really mean? For us it means solving merchant problems at scale. For example, most small businesses need additional funds at some point to grow their business. By algorithmically -predicting merchants’ growth potential, Shopify has facilitated over $500 million in capital loans to small business owners That’s one of many different product-lines looking for Senior Data Scientists to partner with and help drive value for our merchants.

The Risk Algorithms team is at the forefront of fighting against credit-card fraud. If you are interested in working with a diverse and dynamic team on developing near-real time fraud detection models based on petabytes of high quality but highly imbalanced data and influencing business decisions for Fraud Protect (https://www.shopify.com/fraud-protect), join them in making sure that well earned money stays with merchants.

Platform
Our Platform team helps merchants meet 100% of their individual needs through apps and services. The endless diversity of our merchants means that each of them requires niche features in commerce that don’t necessarily align with Shopify’s core feature. This team directly impacts Shopify by solving diverse, individual merchant problems at scale through apps and services created by our third party partner ecosystem and we want to make sure that we are as data informed as we can in this approach. With tens of thousands of app developers and partners in our ecosystem, this team helps build recommendation systems around which ones are best suited to a merchants needs.

Data is more than information; in the right hands, it’s a valuable currency that can build fortunes. We’ll give you the tools to turn insight into extraordinary experiences for people and their machines.

About you

You put analytics into action, using insight as the common thread between machine learning and human experiences. You’re on top of emerging and established technologies and know how to creatively design experiences that are centered on humans as well as machines.

About the role

On its own, data holds relatively little value. Data’s worth lies in how it’s used and analyzed; how people and machines respond to the insights it generates. That’s where you come in. We need your analytical mind to sort through data’s endless possibilities and design seamless experiences for analyzing and using data.

As a Senior Data Scientist, you’ll be practicing at the top of your field, considering and developing experiences from a human and technological viewpoint. Working on multiple projects simultaneously, you’ll play a key role in discovering and solving issues facing businesses in the digital age, identifying trends, predicting outcomes and presenting your findings.

In the role, you will:
Develop project plans for reporting tools, information dashboards, data generators, and other resources

Help teams provide technology-based data reporting tools and management

Offer or source advice to help recommend solutions for company reporting and data needs

Create technical and strategic reports that address business issues and clarify opportunities

Build reports and regular datasets for users with system tools and database or data warehouse queries and scripts

Integrate data from various sources to produce data elements

Program and maintain report forms and formats, information dashboards, data generators, canned reports and other user resources

Create specifications for reports based on business requests

Travel, as needed.

Your skills

You can run both programs and projects, with plenty of experience working with data mining, analysis and modeling large-scale, complex datasets. You know your way around analytics and statistical modeling tools and can communicate complex methodologies and concepts in non-technical language.

You excel at analysis, whether it’s statistical, quantitative, predictive, or optimization, and you’re confident in high-level programming languages, such as S, C++, Python or Julia.

You probably have a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics, Statistics or another relevant field, with five to seven years of experience. We’d love it if you’ve been working with clients.

Ideally, your experience includes:
Predictive analytics tools such as R, Revolution R, SAS, SPSS, MATLAB, MicroStrategy, and Tableau

Multivariate testing (A/B testing) and optimization algorithms

At least one high-level programming language

NoSQL databases and tools, such as Hadoop, Hive Spark

Outstanding written and verbal communication and presentation skills

Partnering with sales teams on analytics opportunities

Supervising and mentoring junior colleagues.

Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.
Data Scientist - Engineering
Job Description
At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and frustration in their financial lives.

Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
Benefits
Your choice of hardware - latest MacBook Pro or HP EliteBook and all the monitors you want!

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.
